== Known issues

Confluence has issues with the output of asciidoctor

=== Tables
asciidoctor uses colbgroups to set the column width. For some unknown reason, confluence applies the width settings in colgroups in *REVERSE* order.
Therefore the tool contains a fix, which removes the colgroups and puts the width on the table headers.
